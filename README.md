---------------------
(Line space is important for starting new para, else MD would consider new line with same para of previous line. Tab spaces are critical for indentation. Select Tabs with Spaces of 4 to correctly indent)

Line with no Tab of 4 spaces

	Line with 1 Tab of 4 spaces
	
		Line with 2 Tab of 4 spaces
		
			Line with 3 Tab of 4 spaces
			
				Line with 4 Tab of 4 spaces



Looking at Ordered List with Indented Text

1. First List Item

	This Paragraph is indented upto first list item

2. Second List Item

	This Paragraph is indented such that it is shown under second list item. But here we have few more points further indented under this paragraph

	a. First Point

		Explain First Point

	b. Second Point

	This is more explaination of second list item

# My Fabulous Recipe

This recipe for **cereal and milk** has been passed down my family for months.

## Ingredients
- Cereal (you can find cool cereals [here](www.example.com/coolcereals))
- Milk

## Directions

If I were writing these out as <em>code</em>, it might look something like this:

```
if bowl is empty:
    add cereal
if bowl only has cereal in it:
    add milk
```

# Tables (Very Important)
Heading 1 | Heading 2
----------|--------
Rule 1 | Pipe Sign used as Column Separator
Rule 2 | Dashes with Pipe sign used in second line under Heading to indicate that above line is Heading
Rule 3 | Add as many lines as required with equal number of pipe sign to ensure table is correctly filled
